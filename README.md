## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements an automated detection system for **oil spills** using anomaly detection techniques. The system is designed to flag potential oil-spill regions in satellite/remote imagery, helping in environmental monitoring and rapid response.

### 🚀 Key Features  
- Detect anomalous regions in input imagery that may indicate oil spills  
- Visual output overlay highlighting detected anomaly areas  
- Web-based interactive demo allowing users to view imagery  
- Lightweight model for faster inference and real-time utility  
- Clear and reusable codebase ready for experimentation and extension  

### 🔍 Technology Stack  
- Language: Python, JavaScript  
- ML Framework: TensorFlow / PyTorch (choose whichever you used)  
- Web Framework: (e.g., Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit)  
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
- Deployment: GitHub Pages
